# Fruit-Ninja
a program used Kinect and Unity

We made this game from 2021.3 to 2021.7.
### Our work:
1. We used **Kinect** to capture hand gesture, and transfer data to C#.
2. We used **Unity** to **integrated** art assets(including fruits textures, halo animation etc.).
We achieved **particle effect**(trailing of cutting).
We achieved **collision detection**(between fruit sprite and edges of wall)
3. We used **C#** to write **game logic**(start and end,get point and loss life), made decomposed fruits movements(considering gravity and initially elastic force)
4. make a video demo
